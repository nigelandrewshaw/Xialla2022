I said \"Well my only advice is to make sure it's pretty small and not too noticeable in case you want to get it removed later\". <\/p><p>Peter said, \"Well actually I was thinking of a huge one right across my shoulder blades.\"<\/p><p>\"Wow\", I said. \"That's a big commitment. I guess you have something meaningful in mind.\"<\/p><p>He said, \"Yep, Love is the Cure\". <\/p><p>I was pretty stunned with joy that my teenage son would want that. And glad to feel that somehow or another my wife and I had succeeded as parents. <\/p><p>So the tattoo is pretty well known now among Pete's friends. And it's become a bit of a mantra for how our family operates. <\/p><p>With Xialla, it's my greatest hope to keep spreading the love. <\/p><p><em><strong>Nigel<br\/>Inventor of Xialla<\/strong><\/em><\/p>"
